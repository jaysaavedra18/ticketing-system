# Ticketing Management System

This Ticketing Management System allows a company to incorporate their employees onto
our platform. From our application users can manage employees and their roles within
the system. Users can also create projects to manage deadlines, assigned employees,
project leaders, sprints, etc. Additionally, users will also have access to tickets 
where they can submit bug/error requests, application update requests, and much more.
